## Open Enovation

## Problem Statement : 
In today's push for sustainable development, households often struggle with high electricity bills, especially during the summer, due to the lack of solar energy adoption. Despite the availability of advanced technologies, we are not fully utilizing solar panels to tap into renewable energy sources. By embracing solar energy, we can significantly cut down on electricity expenses and make a positive impact on the environment. This shift not only offers financial benefits but also supports global efforts toward sustainability by relying on clean, renewable energy. Investing in solar solutions can help reduce our carbon footprint and create a more eco-friendly future.

## Introduction & Solution :
ny people are unaware of how much solar energy their rooftops can generate and the potential savings from solar panels. To address this, we propose a web platform that uses machine learning to calculate solar energy potential. Users can upload satellite images of their rooftops, and our platform will use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to identify building footprints and calculate areas using GeoPandas and Rasterio. By incorporating solar irradiance data, we can estimate potential energy generation and provide a financial analysis of the savings from solar panel installations. Hosted on cloud platforms like AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud, our solution helps users understand their solar potential and encourages sustainable energy practices.
